# Determining Customer Churn and Lifetime Value
*Leveraging the BG/NBD Model and Gamma Gamma submodel to evaluate and predict customer churn, retention, and lifetime value.*

## Overview
### Purpose
Churn, retention and lifetime value are all trigger terms thrown around constantly in the professional world  - being able to accurately identify, calculate and understand these metrics are critical to any business looking to understand their consumer base and maximize their potential.

Although common analytic approaches such as clustering or classification can be effective in segmenting or predicting churn respectively, one key issue that often exists is the censored data present - that is, the customer's purchasing lifetime is typically unfinished, making the application of this classification (whether a customer has churned or not) very problematic. This is particularly relevant in non-contractual business settings where a consumer can decide to "cut ties" at any moment, so any distinguishing feature of churn needed in order to train a model would essentially be arbitrary (i.e a customer that just made a purchase yesterday may churn tomorrow, and a customer who hasn't made a purchase in 2 years may purchase again tomorrow).

For the current analysis, we leverage "Buy 'Till You Die' probabilistic models to help account for the problem stated above, where in addition to predicting the number of purchases that an individual will make in a future period of time, the probability that said customer will churn is also outputted based on their historical buying behaviour. Given these outputs, we are able to calculate a customer's lifetime value over a variable period of time and begin to analyze overall retention and loyalty of a consumer base. The above approach allows us to make rather accurate predictions with minimal buying behaviour data, and provides a more realistic framework in expressing churn by 
probabilistic means rather than categorical (yes/no boolean). Given this, we are left with a set of rich information that is very easily interpretable for segmenting, targeting and actioning around our consumer base.

### Purchasing Behaviour & Churn - BG/NBD Model
The BTYD model of choice in our analysis is the popularly-used Beta Geometric/Negative Binomial Distribution model - a revised and improved version of the Pareto/NBD model developed in 1987.

Essentially, the model looks to predict future transactions of each individual customer by taking into account their individual purchasing history in reference to the general customer pattern. It treats purchasing phenomena as a two step process: 

**1. Transaction Process ("Buying")**

As long as customer hasn't churned (is "alive), assumptions of the model are:
  - The number of transactions made by a single consumer in a period of time follows a Poisson distribution with a transaction rate λ.
  - Purchases for individual consumers are randomly distributed around their own transaction rate λ.
  - Transaction rate λ varies from consumer to consumer, and follows a Gamma distribution with shape r and scale a for the entire dataset

**2. Dropout Process ("Dieing"):**
   - Every customer has a dropout probability p
   - Dropouts vary from consumer to consumer, and follows a Beta distribution with parameters a and β for the entire dataset

### CLTV - Gamma Gamma Submodel
The Gamma Gamma submodel - very popularly paired with the BG/NBD model - looks to predict the expected average profit of the consumer (i.e their future average order value) by a very similar process. The assumptions of the model are:
- Order frequency and monetary values (current aov) of customers are not correlated
- Monetary values of individual transactions are randomly distributed around their average order value
- Average order values vary across consumers but are constant within consumers through their lifetime
- Average order values of the entire dataset follow a Gamma distribution
